### The Challenge 

Dr. Vince and Mr. Merrick are back, and hungry for more tasty integrals. You are asked to prepare a dish that resembles an approximation to the volume of a solid with 2D base and geometric cross sections (see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3T25-3Uy4rBvck6k4NuuAfgNY9HRlTT/view?usp=sharing"> Mr. Merrick's </a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3T25-3Uy4rBvck6k4NuuAfgNY9HRlTT/view?usp=sharing"> Dr. Vince's </a> submission for examples). You are also **required** to calculate the theoretical volume of your given solid using integration. 

If you are feeling dangerous you may also attempt cooking a dish that embodies an approximation to a solid of revolution (disks/shells). 

After completing your recipe, you are requested to share a 3-5 minute video with a taste test and thorough description. You are also encouraged to include your cooking performance, and tips and tricks within your video.

You will be given a score based on a 40 point scale marked on three categories:
* Portrayal of approximation method through your recipe and video description (10 points)
* Beauty, style and performance of food and video (10 points)
* Creativity (10 points)
* Taste (judged purely on your reaction to first bite, 10 points)


**GOOD LUCK**, Please *do not* put too many marshmallows in the microwave for too long.
