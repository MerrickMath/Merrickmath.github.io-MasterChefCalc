### The Challenge 

Dr. Vince and Mr. Merrick are back, and hungry for more tasty integrals. You are asked to prepare a dish that resembles an approximation to the volume of a solid with 2D base and geometric cross sections. You are also **required** to calculate the theoretical volume of your given solid using integration. 

If you are feeling dangerous you may also attempt cooking a dish that embodies an approximation to a solid of revolution (disks/shells). 

After completing your recipe, you are requested to share a 3-5 minute video with a taste test and thorough description. You are also encouraged to include your cooking performance, and tips and tricks within your video.

You may work individually, or in teams of 2.

You will be given a score based on a 40 point scale marked on three categories:
* Portrayal of approximation method through your recipe and video description (10 points)
* Beauty, style and performance of food and video (10 points)
* Creativity (10 points)
* Taste (judged purely on your reaction to first bite, 10 points)


**GOOD LUCK**, Please *do not* put too many marshmallows in the microwave for too long.
